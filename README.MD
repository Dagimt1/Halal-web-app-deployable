Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the Halal Restaurant Finder application on your local machine for development and testing.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/halal-restaurant-finder.git
cd halal-restaurant-finder
2. Install Dependencies
Client
Navigate to the client folder and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Server
Navigate to the server folder and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../server
npm install
Database Setup
1. Install PostgreSQL
Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from PostgreSQL's official website.

2. Create the Database
Connect to your PostgreSQL server and create a new database:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE halal_restaurant_finder;
3. Create Tables and Insert Sample Data
Connect to the newly created database and create the required tables:

sql
Copy code
-- Switch to the halal_restaurant_finder database
\c halal_restaurant_finder;

-- Create the `restaurants` table
CREATE TABLE restaurants (
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price_range INT NOT NULL CHECK (price_range >= 1 and price_range <= 5)
);

-- Insert sample data into `restaurants`
INSERT INTO restaurants (id, name, location, price_range) VALUES 
(123, 'MCDONALDS', 'NEW YORK', 3);

-- Create the `reviews` table
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    restaurant_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES restaurants(id),
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    review TEXT NOT NULL,
    rating INT NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5)
);
4. Configure Environment Variables
In the server folder, create a .env file to store your database connection details:

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Add the following variables to the .env file:

env
Copy code
PORT=3001
PGUSER=your_postgres_username
PGHOST=localhost
PGPASSWORD=your_postgres_password
PGDATABASE=halal_restaurant_finder
PGPORT=5432
Replace your_postgres_username and your_postgres_password with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

Running the Application
1. Start the Server
Navigate to the server folder and start the server:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm start
The server will start at http://localhost:3001.

2. Start the Client
Open a new terminal, navigate to the client folder, and start the client:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm start
The client will start at http://localhost:3000.

3. Access the Application
Once both the server and client are running, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the Halal Restaurant Finder application.
